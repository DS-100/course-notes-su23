<p><em>With thanks to guest lecturer Ari Edmundson.</em></p>
<p>Let’s immerse ourselves in the real-world story of data scientists working for an organization called the Cook County Assessor’s Office (CCAO). Their job is to <strong>estimate the values of houses</strong> in Cook County, Illinois, in order to <strong>determine property taxation rates</strong>. This is because the property tax burden (the amount of tax to be paid by a homeowner) in this area is determined by the estimated <strong>value</strong> of a house. The homeowner of a house that is higher in value will have to pay <em>more</em> property tax than the homeowner of a house that is lower in value.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the CCAO, a house’s “value” may differ from its <em>price</em> on the housing market, which is why assessment of properties is necessary. Additionally, some homes may have never been listed on the housing market before, so they have no established “sale price.” Since values change over time and there is no obvious indicators of value, the CCAO created a <strong>model</strong> to estimate the values of houses. In this lecture, we will dig deep into issues of biases encoded into this model, the consequences for human lives, and how we can learn from this example to do better.</p>
<section id="the-problem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>A 2017 <a href="https://apps.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/cook-county-property-tax-divide/assessments.html">report</a> by the Chicago Tribune uncovered a major scandal. The team showed that the model perpetuated a highly regressive tax system which disproportionately burdened Black and Latinx homeowners in Cook County.</p>
<p>To understand the implications of a regressive tax system for these communities, we’ll first consider some background.</p>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:50%;">
<p>In the field of housing assessment, assessors often use two metrics to estimate the fairness of assessments: the <a href="https://www.realestateagent.com/real-estate-glossary/real-estate/coefficient-of-dispersion.html">coefficient of dispersion</a> and the <a href="https://leg.wa.gov/House/Committees/FIN/Documents/2009/RatioText.pdf">price-related differential</a>. The details of these metrics are out of scope for Data 100, but you can think of them as methods of measuring the “consistency” with which an assessor assigns values to properties. Investigators found that the property valuations performed by the CCAO did not fall into acceptable ranges.</p>
</div><div class="column" style="width:50%;">

</div>
</div>
<p>This by itself was <strong>not the end</strong> of the story, but was an indicator that <strong>something fishy was going on</strong>.</p>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:10%;">

<p>This finding prompted the investigative team to assess if the model designed by the CCAO was outputting fair tax rates. After accounting for the <strong>income level</strong> of the property homeowner, they found that the CCAO’s model was producing a <strong>regressive</strong> tax system. Properties owned by low-income homeowners were being <em>overvalued</em>, which meant that these homeowners had to pay property taxes at a rate <em>higher</em> than the true worth of their homes.</p>

<p><strong>Regressive:</strong> A tax rate is regressive if the percentage tax rate is higher for individuals with <em>lower</em> net income.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Digging even deeper into the model revealed that the system was not only unfair to homeowners across the axis of income (impacting high-income and low-income communities in different ways), but also unfair over the axis of race. As demonstrated in the figure below, there seemed to be a relationship between a homeowner’s race and the property value assigned by the CCAO model. Houses in regions with predominantly white homeowners tended to be <em>undervalued</em>, meaning that these homeowners had to pay property tax <em>lower</em> than the true worth of their homes.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spotlight-appeals">Spotlight: Appeals</h3>
<p>What was the origin of these disparities in the assessment scheme? The answer is a lot bigger than just the CCAO’s model. At the end of the day, these are real social systems that have a lot of moving parts.</p>
<p>One of those moving parts was the <strong>appeals system</strong>. After the CCAO has performed an assessment, they mail the assessed home value to the homeowner of the property. The homeowner can then choose to appeal this assessment value to a board of elected officials in an attempt to change the final property value, and, thus, how much they will be taxed. In theory, this sounds like a very fair system: there is a human that oversees the final pricing of houses rather than just an algorithm. However, it ended up exacerbating the problems.</p>
<p>“Appeals are a good thing,” Thomas Jaconetty, deputy assessor for valuation and appeals, said in an interview. “The goal here is fairness. We made the numbers. We can change them.”</p>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:10%;">

</div><div class="column" style="width:10%;">

</div><div class="column" style="width:80%;">
<p>On the surface, it’s undeniable that everyone should have the legal right to appeal the assessment decision. However, the current state of the legal system means that not everyone has an equal ability to launch an appeal. Those who have the money to hire <strong>tax lawyers</strong> to appeal the assessment on their behalf have a drastically higher chance of succeeding in their appeal. This model is part of a deeper institutional pattern rife with potential corruption.</p>
<p>Homeowners who appealed were generally under-assessed relative to other homeowners, meaning that their property tax rate was low relative to the true value of their homes. This meant that high-income homeowners ultimately paid proportionately less in property tax. It also meant that tax lawyers were able to grow their businesses due to their growing roles in the appeals process. In Cook County, politicians often shared social connections with both these tax lawyers and the wealthy homeowners they served.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>All these stakeholders – high-income homeowners, tax lawyers, and some politicians – therefore had reasons to advertise the CCAO model as being an integral part of a fair assessment system.</p>
<p>Here lies the value in asking questions. A system that seems fair on the surface may, in actuality, be unfair upon taking a closer look.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="human-impacts">Human Impacts</h3>
<p>The impact of the housing model extends beyond the realm of home ownership and taxation. Discriminatory practices have a long history within the United States, and the model served to perpetuate this fact. To this day, Chicago is one of the most segregated cities in the United States (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-diverse-cities-are-often-the-most-segregated/">source</a>). These factors are central to informing us, as data scientists, about what is at stake.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spotlight-intersection-of-real-estate-and-race">Spotlight: Intersection of Real Estate and Race</h3>
<p>Housing has been a persistent source and manifestation of racial inequality throughout US history. It is one of the most visible areas where inequalities are created and reproduced. In the early 20th century, <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/early-20th-century-us/jim-crow-laws">Jim Crow</a> laws were explicit in systematically excluding people of color from housing opportunities equal to those made available to white communities.</p>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:50%;">
<p>Today, while advancements in civil rights have been made, the ongoing impacts of these laws are tangible in many parts of the US. One legacy of the Jim Crow era is housing segregation born from discriminatory practices in the real estate industry. The real estate industry, guided by almost exclusively white leaders, was “professionalized” in the 1920’s and 1930’s by aspiring to become a science guided by strict methods and principles. One of these principles was known as <strong>redlining</strong>. Redlining involved making it difficult, if not impossible, to get a federally-backed mortgage to buy a house in specific neighborhoods coded as “risky.” Often, neighborhoods were identified as “risky” based on their racial composition. In doing so, the real estate industry attempted to create “objective” rating systems for property assessments that encoded <strong>race</strong> as a factor in valuations.</p>

</div>
<p>The result was that people of color tended to purchase and own homes in areas far from where white homeowners resided. This housing segregation is still present in many communities across the US today, including in Cook County.</p>

<p>The CCAO data scientists then critically examined the housing data available to them. This is the very same housing data that you will work with in Projects A1 and A2.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How was this data collected?</li>
<li>When was this data collected?</li>

</ol>
<p>They found that some housing types were less represented than others in the data used to train the original CCAO model. For example, properties located in the floodplains of Chicago were under-represented relative to other regions in Cook County. Certain features were also recorded at different rates. Improvements in homes, which tend to increase property value, were unlikely to be reported by the homeowners.</p>
<p>Notably, they found that there was simply more missing data in lower income neighborhoods.</p>

<li>What are the biases, anomalies, or other issues with the data?</li>
<li>How do we transform the data to enable effective analysis?</li>
</ul>
<p>Before beginning to formulate new models, the data scientists considered a number of important exploratory questions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Which attributes are most predictive of sales price?</li>
<li>Is the data uniformly distributed?</li>
<li>Do all neighborhoods have up-to-date data? Do all neighborhoods have the same granularity?<br>
</li>
<li>Do some neighborhoods have missing or outdated data?</li>
</ol>
<p>They found that the impact of certain features, such as the number of bedrooms in a home, were much more impactful in determining house value for properties in certain neighborhoods than they were in other neighborhoods. This suggested that different models should be applied for different neighborhoods.</p>
<p>They also noticed that low income neighborhoods had data with disproportionately many missing values. This informed them that they needed to develop new data collection practices – including finding new sources of data.</p>

<p>Rather than using a singular model to predict the sale prices (“fair market value”) of unsold properties, the CCAO fit machine learning models that discover patterns using known sale prices and characteristics of <strong>similar and nearby properties</strong>. It uses different model weights for each township.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional mass appraisal, the CCAO’s new approach is more granular and more sensitive to neighborhood variations.</p>

<p>The model is not the end of the road. The new Office of Data Science still sends homeowners their house evaluations, but now the data that they get sent <em>back</em> from the homeowners is taken into account when refining the model. More detailed reports are being written by the office itself to democratize the information. Town halls and other public facing outreach help to ensure that the whole community is involved in the process of housing evaluations, rather than limiting participation to a select few.</p>
